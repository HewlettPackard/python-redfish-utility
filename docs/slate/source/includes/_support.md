## Remote Support

Remote support is available with supported devices as part of your warranty or contractual support agreement. It provides intelligent event diagnosis, and automatic, secure submission of hardware event notifications to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will initiate a fast and accurate resolution based on your product&apos;s service level. Hewlett Packard Enterprise strongly recommends that you register your device for remote support.
