# Overview

The RESTful Interface Tool (iLOREST) is a command-line interface that allows you to manage Hewlett Packard Enterprise 
products that take advantage of RESTful APIs. For this release of the tool, you can manage HPE Gen11 servers running iLO6 1.10 onwards or Gen10 servers running iLO 5 version 2.10 or later and Gen9 servers running iLO 4 version 2.10 or later through iLO RESTful APIs.
